## Notebooks for Google colab
We have two notebooks:
1) Employing ProtFlow to design a binder for a protein using
   * RFidffusion
   * LigandMPNN
   * Boltz
2) Creating an artificial motif using ProtFlow in combination with the RiffDiff pipeline

Both are not real examples due a very limited number of designs or artificial motifs computed, but will give a ready-to use, interactive introduction how to use this tools
